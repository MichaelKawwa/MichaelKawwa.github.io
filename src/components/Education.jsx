    It became clear to me before I started College that I wanted to study Computer Science. My earlier years had set a strong foundation already but I was ready for the next step in my career. This all started at Stony Brook University. 
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    Currently I am in my third year here studying Computer Science. The program is known for being quite rigorous and competitive, a fact that might have concerned me in freshman year but now drives me to take pride in my learning journey! The challenges I faced and overcame helped make me a more competent and confident software developer. I now feel more equipped than ever in my abilities. I have fostered not only technical skills but soft skills which made me a better team player, collaborator, and communicator.

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    I took a wide array of courses which have expanded my computer science knowledge. 
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    Classes like CSE 114 and CSE 214 gave me an exceptionally strong foundation for working with java and extended this foundation to the understanding of data structures and algorithms. This helped me not only write code that works but code that works efficiently. We had to write, debug, and test our code for the homeworks which made me a more diligent programmer.
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    I got to learn about different programming concepts and paradigms in CSE 216 which helped me see under the hood of how some of my favorite programming languages work and why they were designed that way. This also helped me develop a greater understanding of object oriented programming. Knowing the limitations and design rules of many programming languages like python and java was essential for me to efficiently create programs in regards to a certain language. Similarly in CSE 371, we delved deeper into some of the most useful algorithms to explore not only how they work but why they work. Having this understanding was crucial for my foundational knowledge and made it possible for me to know when and why I should use certain algorithms. 
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    I got to see under the hood of how computers work at a lower level in CSE 220 and CSE 320, where we explored System Fundamentals through Java, C, and Assembly programming. Learning along the concepts like bitwise operations, memory management, concurrency, performance analysis, and other lower level operations that revealed to me how assemblers, linkers, and compilers work to take a program in C all the way to an executable. Having an understanding of what's really going on when you write a program, helped me not only appreciate the ease with which higher level languages simplify these topics but also gave me the ability to write better performing code both in low level and high level programming.
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    Courses like CSE 337 helped equip me with practical knowledge on web development in which we go in depth through the MERN stack, eventually creating a reddit clone called ‚Äòphreddit‚Äô as a final project with my teammate. Working with a teammate on this project using github helped me simulate a real workflow collaborating on a large software project. I learned efficient ways to divide tasks and resolve merge conflicts when they arise. Similarly I learned many practical skills in courses like CSE 337 in which we learned a wide array of scripting languages including, python, ruby, and bash. These skills are valuable and helped me easily and quickly create scripts for all kinds of different tasks.

    A good amount of my growth here at SBU took place outside the classroom.
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    In my first semester of Sophomore year I joined a program called VIP which consists of student groups headed by professors working on a project. My team was working on a project called LOQI, which is a student learning platform using AI for students to learn and collaborate with other classmates. Working on LOQI I developed a greater proficiency using react for frontend development and learned to work as part of a team efficiently using github to collaborate. 
    </p>

    <p style={{margin: '20px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
    Currently I have recently started an internship which will turn into a part time job next semester, for the department of IT. My role will be that of a student software developer working on and creating the many applications that help the school function in its day to day. I am extremely excited for what this opportunity will bring!
